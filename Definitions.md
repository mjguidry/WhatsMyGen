### Definitions

**Childhood** is defined as the age range starting at birth, and ending at the most commonly used age of majority, 18.

A **generation** is defined as a group of people who would have all been considered children on at least one common date. Since childhood lasts until 18 years of age, a generation would then be 18 years long.

A generational **tier** (from the French *tiers*, which means one-third), is a group of people who would have been in the same stage of childhood on at least one common date, such as Preschool (ages 0 - 5) or Adolescence (ages 12 - 17). Since all those in a tier have been in the same stage of life together, the members of a tier will have a more unifying set of common experiences, than within the larger generation. Each tier is one-third of a generation, or 6 years long.

The **First** tier are the pioneers of the generation, the first group of people to establish what the new generation will be like. They may share some characteristics with the previous generation.

The **Middle** tier are unambiguously members of the present generation, having the least in common with either the previous generation, or the new to come. They may be the most "stereotypical" members of the generation.

The **Young** tier are the newest members of the generation, who though they belong to it, also begin to show the changes that will lead to a new generation. They may feel as much in common with the First of the next generation, as with the Middle that came before them.
