<a id="Q1.1">**1.1 Why did you make this site?**</a>
This site is my attempt to respond to some of the issues with how social generations have been commonly defined. 

One is that, while we have become familiar with terms like "Baby Boomer" and "Millennial", there is no universally agreed definition for each generation. Consider just a few sources:

Generation | Pew Research Center | Nielsen Ratings | Strauss and Howe 
---------- | ------------------- | ----------------| ----------- 
Greatest   | 1901 to 1927        | 1917 to 1946    | 1901 to 1924
Silent     | 1928 to 1945        | -               | 1925 to 1942
Boomer     | 1946 to 1964        | 1947 to 1964    | 1943 to 1960
Gen X      | 1965 to 1980        | 1965 to 1979    | 1961 to 1981
Millennial | 1981 to 1996        | 1980 to 1996    | 1982 to 2004 

With no common definition, the person born in 1981 is left to wonder, "Am I Gen X? Or a Millennial?" With each of the boundaries uncertain, those near those boundaries are never quite sure how to self-identify. 

Another issue arises with the uneven length of each generational definition. For example, when evaluating a claim such as "there are more voters in Generation A than in Generation B", the claim loses some of its impact if Generation A is defined to cover a 20 year span and Generation B, a 15 year span. At present, Pew Research defines the Boomer generation as a 19 year span and Gen X as 16 years; it would be amazing if the Boomer generation **weren't** larger, by that definition. By fixing each generation to 18 years, then the comparison between them should be more meaningful.

Finally, there has been some feeling that the generational category itself is too wide, that no matter how a generation is defined, those at the beginning of the generation may not feel very connected to those at the end of it. A Baby Boomer born in 1946 had the possibility of being drafted for the Vietnam War; one born in 1960 would have reached adulthood after the war, and with no draft requirement in place. I came up with the "tier" idea to define a subset of a generation, one that would have all been in grade school together, and thus would have had more things in common than with the whole generation. The tier should be a more cohesive group than the whole generation.

No, not really. I have no training in any kind of social science, and I am not trying to override anyone's serious work. This is meant to be fun, just something to help answer the questions above, in a personal way.
