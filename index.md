Welcome to WhatsMyGen!

This is a fun little site, which uses my own definitions for each generation, and for smaller sub-generations called "tiers" (which I think better define a birth cohort with common traits).

You may want to start out by reading the [Definitions](Definitions.md), go straight to the [Generations](Generations.md) pages, or if you have any questions, head to the [FAQ](FAQ.md).

The work here is built upon all of the great crowdsourcing at the [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/), and on the work of the [The Open Wikipedia Ranking](http://wikirank-2019.di.unimi.it/index.html) project at the [Laboratory for Web Algorithmics](http://law.di.unimi.it/) of the [Universit√† degli Studi di Milano](http://www.unimi.it/).
