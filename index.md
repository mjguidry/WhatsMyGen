Welcome to MikeGen!

This is a fun little site, which uses my own definitions for each generation, and for smaller sub-generations (which I think better define a birth cohort with common traits).

You may want to start out by reading the [Definitions](Definitions.md), go straight to the [Generations](Generations.md) pages, or if you are a visual person, perhaps go to the [Timeline](Timeline.md).
