# MikeGen

Welcome to MikeGen!

This is a fun little site, which uses my own definitions for each generation, and for smaller sub-generations (which I think better define a birth cohort with common traits).

You may want to check out the About page to understand my definitions, go straight to the Generations page, or if you are a visual person, perhaps go to the [Timeline](Timeline.md).
