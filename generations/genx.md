### Generation X
#### 1964 to 1981
<br>
>We named this unknown generation, The **Generation X**, and even in our first enthusiasm we realised that we had something far bigger than our talents and pockets could cope with.

The above quote was actually about young people coming of age in the post WWII era (the Silent Generation), and since then the term was used in a 1965 book about youth culture in Britain (the Boomer Generation), the Billy Idol band, and then finally got its contemporary usage from the book <em>Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture</em> in 1991. For this site, **Generation X** are those Americans born between 1964 and 1981.
