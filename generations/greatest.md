### Greatest Generation
#### 1910 to 1927
<br>
>During NBC's coverage of the fiftieth anniversary of D-Day, I was asked by Tim Russert on <em>Meet the Press</em> my thoughts on what we were witnessing. As I looked over the assembled crowd of veterans, which included everyone from Cabinet officers and captains of industry to retired schoolteachers and machinists, I said, "I think this is the **greatest generation** any society has ever produced." I know that this was a bold statement and a sweeping judgement, but since then I have restated it on many occassions. While I am periodicallly challenged on this premise, I believe I have the facts on my side.

The men and women who fought in WWII have sometimes been called the "World War II Generation" or the "G.I. Generation", but the term "Greatest Generation" seems to have become preferred, after Tom Brokaw's book. For this site, the **Greatest Generation** are those Americans born between 1910 and 1927, and so would have come of age during the Great Depression, or during WWII.
