### The Lost Generation
>It was when we had come back from Canada and were living in the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs and Miss Stein and I were still good friends that Miss Stein made the remark about the lost generation. She had some ignition trouble with the old Model T Ford she then drove and the young man who worked in the garage and had served in the last year of the war had not been adept, or perhaps had not broken the priority of other vehicles, in repairing Miss Stein’s Ford. Anyway he had not been sérieux and had been corrected severely by the patron of the garage after Miss Stein’s protest. The patron had said to him, “You are all a génération perdue.”

>“That’s what you are. That’s what you all are,” Miss Stein said. “All of you young people who served in the war. You are a lost generation.”

The term "Lost Generation" has been applied to either a group of expatriate writers living in Paris in the 1920s, or more broadly to the generation that experienced the horrors of World War I firsthand, as in the quote above. For this site, the Lost generation is the group of people who were born between 1892 and 1909. This would be those who came of age leading up to or during WWI, or in the "Roaring Twenties" that followed.
