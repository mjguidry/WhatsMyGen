### Silent Generation
#### 1928 to 1945
<br>
>By comparison with the Flaming Youth of their fathers & mothers, today’s younger generation is a still, small flame. It does not issue manifestoes, make speeches or carry posters. It has been called the **‘Silent Generation.’** But what does the silence mean? What, if anything, does it hide?

The decline in birth rates due to the Great Depression meant a smaller generation than that which came before, and certainly smaller than the Baby Boomers to come; some have called this generation the "Lucky Few". For this site, the **Silent Generation** are those Americans born between 1928 and 1945, which would have been during the Great Depression or World War II.
